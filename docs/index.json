Though light acts as a clean and non-contact stimulus for inducing changes in temporary shapes, light-induced deformations cannot be fixed under our ambient conditions. Herein, a new kind of shape memory polyurethanes was prepared by chemically cross-linking of polyethylene glycol and 4,4‚Ä≤-dihydroxyazobenzene with 1,3,5,7-tetrahydroxyadamantane in one-step method. The sythesized SMPUs are capable of shape deformation under ultraviolet-light (UV-light) and shape fixation in visible light and then the original shape can be recovered in room temperature water. Owing to the outstanding UV-light and water effect of SMPUs, the SMPUs exhibit a rapid UV-light response shape memory process and a rapid recovery in water with the 4,4‚Ä≤-dihydroxyazobenzene content of 3.1 wt%. The study of the versatility of the synthesized SMPUs can expands the current understanding of the multi-stage stimuli-responsive features in both light- and water- induced SMPUs, illuminating a new mechanism of multi-stage stimuli-responsive shape memory effects.","tags":[],"title":"Shape memory polyurethanes with UV light-triggered deformation and water-induced recovery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuqin Fu","Jiaping Zhu","Faxing Zou","Xierong Zeng","Shaojun Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

A series of zwitterionic SMPUs was successfully prepared with N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), 1,3-propanesultone (1,3-PS), 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and polyethylene glycol (PEG6000). The influence of MDEA-PS-based zwitterionic hard segment on structure, morphology, thermal property, shape memory property and cytocompatibility were systematically investigated. The results demonstrated that the PEG-based zwitterionic SMPUs (PEG-ZSMPUs) formed phase separation structure consisting of crystalline soft phase and amorphous hard phase. The MDEA-PS zwitterionic segments showed a tendency to form ionic clusters in hard segments, which served as reinforced net points. Shape memory analysis showed that zwitterionic PEG-ZSMPUs containing a high content of zwitterionic segments had thermal-induced shape memory effects. Finally, cytotoxic assays demonstrated that MDEA-PS zwitterionic segment improved the biocompatibility of PEG-ZSMPUs. The zwitterionic PEG-ZSMPUs could thus have a promising application in smart biomedical fields.","tags":[],"title":"A novel adamantane-based polyurethane with shape memory effect","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
