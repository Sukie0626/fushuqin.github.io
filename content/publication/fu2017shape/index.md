abstract: This work aimed at elucidating the influence of zwitterionic hard segments on the structures and properties of shape memory polyurethanes (SMPUs). A series of zwitterionic SMPUs was successfully prepared with N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), 1,3-propanesultone (1,3-PS), 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and polyethylene glycol (PEG6000). The influence of MDEA-PS-based zwitterionic hard segment on structure, morphology, thermal property, shape memory property and cytocompatibility were systematically investigated. The results demonstrated that the PEG-based zwitterionic SMPUs (PEG-ZSMPUs) formed phase separation structure consisting of crystalline soft phase and amorphous hard phase. The MDEA-PS zwitterionic segments showed a tendency to form ionic clusters in hard segments, which served as reinforced net points. Shape memory analysis showed that zwitterionic PEG-ZSMPUs containing a high content of zwitterionic segments had thermal-induced shape memory effects. Finally, cytotoxic assays demonstrated that MDEA-PS zwitterionic segment improved the biocompatibility of PEG-ZSMPUs. The zwitterionic PEG-ZSMPUs could thus have a promising application in smart biomedical fields.
