I am currently living in Cambridge and looking for a research associate or scientist position related to chemical engineering or materials science in Cambridge. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the College of Materials Science and Engineering in Shenzhen University, working with Professor Shaojun Chen. I obtained my Doctor of Engineering degree in chemical engineering from Guangdong University of Technology in June 2016, working with Professor Jianwei Guo. I am also interested in multidisciplinary research. I am passionate about science with strong technical, innovative and interpersonal skills for working in a team. I have successfully completed several scientific research projects and published related research papers.
