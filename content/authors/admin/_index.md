I am currently living in Cambridge and looking for a postdoctoral position or researcher related to chemical engineering or materials science in Cambridge. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the College of Materials Science and Engineering of Shenzhen University, working with Professor Shaojun Chen. I obtained my Ph.D in chemical engineering from Guangdong University of Technology in June 2016, working with Professor Jianwei Guo and Dongyu Zhu.
